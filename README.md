Food Image Classification using CNN This project presents a deep learning approach for classifying food images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to accurately identify various types of food from images, making it useful for applications like restaurant menu scanning, diet tracking apps, or food recognition APIs.

üìÅ Project Structure CNN_network(food_image_classification).ipynb ‚Äî Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

üß† Model Overview Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for feature extraction and image classification. Built using Keras with a TensorFlow backend. Includes image preprocessing such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation for improving model generalization. Trained on a labeled food image dataset with multiple classes.

üìä Features Data loading and preprocessing (train/test split, normalization, augmentation) CNN architecture implementation Model training and validation with metrics Visualization of training history (accuracy & loss) Evaluation on test set with classification metrics Prediction visualization for sample images

üîß Technologies Used Python TensorFlow / Keras NumPy Matplotlib Scikit-learn (for evaluation)

üìà Performance Achieved X% accuracy on the validation set (replace with your actual performance metrics). Handles Y classes of food (e.g., pizza, burger, sushi...).

üì¶ Dataset This project uses the Food-101 dataset ‚Äî a comprehensive benchmark dataset for food image classification, provided by the TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) library. Dataset Details: 101 food categories 101,000 total images 750 training images per class 250 test images per class

üöÄ How to Run

Clone the repo: #bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-image-classification-cnn.git cd food-image-classification-cnn

Install required packages: #bash pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the notebook:- Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run all cells.

üìå Future Improvements: Use pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) for transfer learning. Expand dataset for better generalization. Deploy model as an API or mobile app.

Result Example: Input Image | Predicted Label | Confidence | Pizza | 98.5% | Sushi | 95.1% | Burger | 97.3%
